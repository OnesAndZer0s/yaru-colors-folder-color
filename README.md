# yaru-colors_and_folder-color

In this repository I'm adapting the [Yaru-Colors](https://github.com/Jannomag/Yaru-Colors) icons created by [Jan Schr√∂der
](https://github.com/Jannomag) for working with [Folder Color](https://costales.github.io/projects/folder-color/).

This will allow a perfect integration of Yaru with Folder Color in Ubuntu 20.04:
